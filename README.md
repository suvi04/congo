Collisions (Friend): When the player meets the friend, the friend is added to the conga line and ~~a new friend appears on a new location.~~

Conga line: Ensure that the conga line stays in order and the followers follow the player character.

Collisions (Follower): When the player hits a follower within the conga line, a Game Over message is displayed and the game stops.

~~Score: Display the score as the number of followers the player has collected.~~
